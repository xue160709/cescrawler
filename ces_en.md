![LCD Sun-Burn Free Conventional AR HUD](https://www.ces.tech/media/tcdjlzad/lcdsun-burnfreeconventionalarhud.jpg?width=1000&height=666&format=webp&quality=80)

## Description
AR-HUD should have a wide FoV to show AR information. However, for AR-HUD with a wide FoV range, it is difficult to use LCD-based PGUs, because a lot of solar energy is concentrated on the PGU and cause damage. Therefore, most AR-HUDs are based on DLP/LCoS projection PGUs, which are expensive and show the same or lower image quality. This problem is a big problem for expanding the AR-HUD market. MOBIS has developed a sun-burn issue for LCD-based PGUs, which has price competitiveness and good image quality, so we believe that it will greatly contribute to expanding the AR market.
