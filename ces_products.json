    "description": "SolidVUE will showcase its SL-2.2 at CES 2025—the world’s first 400x128 high-resolution single-chip LiDAR sensor IC designed for compact solid-state LiDAR. Paired with a VCSEL array-based emitter, this technology offers lower cost, smaller size, and improved vibration reliability compared to traditional mechanical LiDAR. The SL-2.2 integrates a high-density SPAD pixel array, time-to-digital converter (TDC), image signal processor, and peripheral circuits on a single chip. It delivers 400x128 high-resolution 3D point-cloud images with a wide Field-of-View (FOV), enabling precise object detection up to 200 meters, making it ideal for autonomous vehicles, security, and robotics applications."

Ryzen 7 9800X3D processor can demonstrate substantial generational improvements in minimum frame rates even when average frame rates are similar, providing the user with an experience that feels smoother, with less stutter. With the AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D processor, AMD has re-engineered its cutting-edge on-chip memory solution with 2nd Gen AMD 3D V-Cache technology. The 64MB cache memory has been relocated below the processor, which puts the core complex die (CCD) closer to the cooling solution to help keep the \"Zen 5\" cores cooler, delivering high clock rates and providing up to an average 8% gaming performance improvement compared to the last-generation Ryzen X3D and up to an average 20% faster than the competition. This revolutionary change in placement allows for extreme overclocking of the processor. It's the first X3D processor to be fully unlocked, empowering enthusiasts and gamers to push its performance to new limits."

    "description": "IM_Pathfinder_Navi is a next-generation robotic intervention system designed to treat critical vascular diseases such as thrombosis, myocardial infarction, and stroke - among the leading causes of global mortality. This innovative system provides easy, fast, and precise 3D steering of magnetic guidewires through its advanced magnetic field control, significantly reducing procedure time. Shorter procedures not only minimize patient radiation exposure but also enable quicker recovery. Medical staff can operate the system remotely using controls like a 3D mouse or joystick, allowing them to perform surgeries from a separate area and reducing their radiation exposure to nearly zero."

However, for AR-HUD with a wide FoV range, it is difficult to use LCD-based PGUs, because a lot of solar energy is concentrated on the PGU and cause damage. Therefore, most AR-HUDs are based on DLP/LCoS projection PGUs, which are expensive and show the same or lower image quality. This problem is a big problem for expanding the AR-HUD market. MOBIS has developed a sun-burn issue for LCD-based PGUs, which has price competitiveness and good image quality, so we believe that it will greatly contribute to expanding the AR market."

Since 2023, we've collaborated with Professor Peter So's team at MIT's Biological Engineering department on clinical trials. We plan to conduct larger trials at the Joslin Diabetes Center later this year and aim for FDA approval in 2025. Our data so far indicates that MOGLU could potentially become the first FDA-approved noninvasive CGM."

One of the most crucial factors in rescuing victims is the time it takes to locate them. However, surfaces like water and snow are highly reflective, making detection difficult. VDS addresses this issue by combining reflection control cameras with AI analysis.This technology is compatible with any camera, including single-camera systems, regardless of the manufacturer. For existing video surveillance systems, it can be easily implemented by simply replacing the cameras. It enables precise control of the light entering the lens or the human eye, allowing versatile applications in devices like smartphones, sunglasses, binoculars and scopes."
